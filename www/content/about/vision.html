<p>openflightHPC is an open-source community developing a <b>flexible</b>, <b>functional</b> and <b>stable</b> HPC stack that can be launched on any platform.</p>
<p>This community is developing separate, modular tools that cover the entire cluster building process. From designing to deploying to managing the cluster architecture for any workflow.</p>
<p>Part of this project is the inception of the <a href="/about/hpc-mountain">HPC Mountain</a> which breaks down the stages of HPC cluster creation into logical stages. The tools which are being developed intend on addressing each stage of the process. All the tools will be stand-alone such that each one can assist cluster creation even if other tools are used for earlier or later stages of the build process.</p>
<p>With so many possible use cases and individual workflows out there it is our vision to create flexible tools to support all of these possibilities. The toolkits provide helpers and simplified processes for doing common cluster configuration procedures. Creating kickstart files for a couple of hundred nodes, deploying multiple interconnected instances to AWS, executing configuration scripts on a group of nodes. All of these common practices become straightforward with the openflightHPC toolkit.</p>
