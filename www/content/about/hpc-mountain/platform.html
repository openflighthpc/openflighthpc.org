<p>This is the second level of the HPC mountain. Platform consists of the deployment and management of resources on the cluster platform.</p>
<p>The platform stage largely involves configuring the base level of resources, namely:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Deploying Resources</b> - Building the hardware or configuring the virtual/cloud resources to be as desired.</li>
    <li><b>Power Management</b> - Remotely checking and changing the power status of resources.</li>
</ul>
