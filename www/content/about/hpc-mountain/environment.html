<p>This is the third stage in the HPC mountain. Environment involves installing and managing the software, applications and resource usage of the cluster.</p>
<p>Considerations for environment configuration are mainly:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Consistent Configuration</b> - Ensuring that version numbers and software settings are the same on all systems that are to run the software.</li>
    <li><b>Run Order</b> - Ensuring that the configuration process follows an identical process on nodes to ensure synchronised.</li>
    <li><b>Paper Trail</b> - Tracking changes to systems in order to aid troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>
