heading: Architecture

<p>This is the bottom of the HPC mountain. Architecture consists of the initial research environment design and choices related to what, where and how resources will be deployed.</p>
<p>Architecture design is the first and most critical step of research environment creation. It determines the platforms, tools and configuration of hardware and software. Key considerations of architecture are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Deployment Platform</b> - The resource solution for the research environment, whether it be cloud, on-premise metal or virtualisation.</li>
    <li><b>Node Structure</b> - The layout, purpose and differences between different node types in the research environment.</li>
    <li><b>Network Configuration</b> - The subnets, separate networks, VLANs and any other configuration details regarding system interconnect.</li>
    <li><b>Operating System</b> - The operating system to use and roughly how it will be considered (e.g. package groups to install).</li>
    <li><b>Resistance and Redundancy</b> - The required level of stability and systems in place to prevent loss of data.</li>
    <li><b>Naming Conventions</b> - The fully qualified domain name and logical structures applied to the nodes in the research environment to better identify them.</li>
    <li><b>Security</b> - The controls and restrictions in place to protect data and access to the system.</li>
</ul>
