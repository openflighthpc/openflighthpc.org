<p>Ready to get started in OpenFlightHPC?  We’ve got certification and resource packs here.</p>


<p>Welcome to the OpenFlightHPC request site for resources and certification.</p>

<p>In order to ensure our community is made up of the best users for our tools we’ve created a set of certifications to get people started.  There is no cost associated, just the ability to get familiar with our core structure in order to help evolve our HPC stack to keep up with the needs of today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>The certifications start with a basic boot camp and run all the way up to a full master certification. You can decide how many levels you want certification in based on your own experience - there is no requirement to do all four levels!</p>

<p>We see the process of cluster creation much like we see the journey up <a href="/about/hpc-mountain.html">HPC Mountain</a>, each layer building upon the other.  As you attain more knowledge with OpenFlightHPC we hope you feed that back to the community in order to make our tool stronger for future generations.</p>
