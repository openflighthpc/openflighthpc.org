<p>Do you already have a research environment or cluster?</p>

<p>If you already have a research environment then OpenFlight tools can help with improving the usability and management of existing environments. Also, there are plenty of guides and tools for those that do not have a research environment to be able to get started with making or obtaining one.</p>
