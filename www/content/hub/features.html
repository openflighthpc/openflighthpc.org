<h2>What is the hub?</h2>
<p>The OpenFlightHPC Hub is a CentOS 7 image loaded with the OpenFlightHPC tools and some additional content to get a cluster up and running.</p>
<p>The hub is packaged with flight-architect, flight-cloud and flight-metal. Allowing for control over configuration, deployment and management of a cluster. Additionally, the system is configured to share the content files and scripts out-of-the-box, allowing for a streamlined cluster deployment process.</p> 
<p><b>Launch your own hub today by following the <a href="/hub/usage.html">hub deployment guide</a>.</b></p>
