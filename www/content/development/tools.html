<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>openflightHPC provides separate tools for each stage of the <a href="/about/hpc-mountain.html">HPC Mountain</a>. These tools are standalone so there's no requirement to use all three tools to deploy a cluster. The tools do have export/import processes such that, when using all three tools, the creation process can be seamlessly connected together.</p>

<h3>Flight Architect</h3>
<p>Flight Architect is a powerful templating engine. Architect creates a platform-agnostic cluster configuration which it will use to generate deployment files, run scripts and other content for all of its supported platforms. The tool is massively expandable with custom configuration and content to ensure that any kind of cluster can be templated.</p>
